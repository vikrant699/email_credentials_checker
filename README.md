## Email Credentials Checker

Will confirm all the emails and if the credentials are correct for private domains like mail.zsthost.com etc. Instructions are in the code if you want to make it compatible with other domains. Pretty useful for checking bulk emails when purchasing bulk steam accounts or something.

## Instructions

- Open cmd/powershell in the same directory
- npm install
- node password.js
